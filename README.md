Welcome to CareCompare 

Concept:  Developing a consumer-facing website to provide a cost comparison of medical procedures based on hospitals in the userâ€™s local area. Leveraging MySQL for the persistence layer, Spring Boot for the middle layer and Angular for the frontend. 

MVP Goals:
Frontend:
- User can choose a medical procedure from a drop down and enter a zip code
-Frontend will send zip and medical procedure id to Spring boot
-display list of hospitals that offer the procedure as well as price

Backend:
-Take in medical procedure and zip from front end and query db for relevant prices
-Take in hospital and procedure information through API

Current Status:
API can take in Hospital info and put information into mysql database locally
